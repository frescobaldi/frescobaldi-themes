# frescobaldi-themes

This repository contains ready to use themes for Frescobaldi and a template to use with [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) theme generators.

## How to install a theme

1. Choose a theme file from `themes` directory and download it.
2. Open Frescobaldi.
3. Navigate to Theme Selection window (Edit -> Preferences -> Fonts & Colors).
4. Click `Menu` right to the current scheme name and choose `Import...` option from the drop-down list.
5. Find the previously downloaded file and open it.
6. Apply changes and now your Frescobaldi should be prettier :-)

## Contributing

If you have a better aesthetic sense than me, you are very welcome to propose changes to this project :-)

Especially: If you also think Frescobaldi deserves a nicer themes manager and know some Python (ideally along with some PyQt) then have a look at this [feature request](https://github.com/frescobaldi/frescobaldi/issues/1157) and consider contributing.
